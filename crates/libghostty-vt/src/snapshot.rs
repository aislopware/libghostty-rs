//! Encode and restore the complete state of a terminal via a binary format.
//!
//! A snapshot is an ordered, CRC-protected record stream. Its READY marker
//! follows enough state to render and resume the terminal, including any
//! unfinished VT parser input. Older scrollback pages follow READY and the
//! FINISH marker terminates the complete snapshot.
//!
//! End-of-file before an operation's required READY or FINISH marker is
//! malformed, truncated snapshot data and returns [`Error::InvalidValue`].
//! [`Error::IoError`] is reserved for reader errors.
//!
//! Decoding is done with the dedicated [`Decoder`] struct; encoding, meanwhile,
//! is supported by methods on [`Terminal`] like [`Terminal::encode_snapshot`].
//!
//! # Format
//!
//! Every integer is unsigned and little-endian.
//! The stream begins with this fixed ten-byte envelope:
//!
//! ```text
//! byte  0               8       10
//!       +---------------+--------+
//!       | "GHOSTSNP"    | version|
//!       | 8-byte magic  | u16    |
//!       +---------------+--------+
//! ```
//!
//! The envelope is followed by independently checksummed records. A record's
//! CRC32C covers its encoded tag and payload length followed by its payload;
//! it does not cover the CRC field itself.
//!
//! ```text
//! byte  0       2             6          10             10 + payload_len
//!       +-------+-------------+-----------+----------------+
//!       | tag   | payload_len | CRC32C    | payload        |
//!       | u16   | u32         | u32       | payload_len B  |
//!       +-------+-------------+-----------+----------------+
//!       \____________________/             \______________/
//!          CRC prefix                         CRC suffix
//! ```
//!
//! Record groups occur in this strict order. SCREEN and HISTORY groups contain
//! one entry for each screen declared by TERMINAL. Each manifest is followed by
//! the number of PAGE records it declares. Active SCREEN pages make the terminal
//! renderable; HISTORY pages are older scrollback ordered newest to oldest so
//! an incremental decoder can prepend them as they arrive.
//!
//! ```text
//!
//! +---------------- TERMINAL ----------------+
//! | terminal-wide state and screen count     |
//! +----------------- SCREEN -----------------+  repeated per screen
//! | active-screen manifest                   |
//! +------------------ PAGE ------------------+  repeated per manifest
//! | active screen rows                       |
//! +------------- CONTINUATION ---------------+
//! | unfinished VT/UTF-8 input, or ground     |
//! +------------------ READY -----------------+
//! | empty renderable-state marker            |  ready() returns here
//! +----------------- HISTORY ----------------+  repeated per screen
//! | scrollback manifest                      |
//! +------------------ PAGE ------------------+  next() consumes one page
//! | older screen rows                        |
//! +------------------ FINISH ----------------+
//! | empty end-of-snapshot marker             |  next() returns NO_VALUE
//! +------------------------------------------+
//! | trailing transport bytes (not consumed) |
//! +------------------------------------------+
//! ```
//!
//! READY separates the renderable prefix through CONTINUATION from history.
//! FINISH terminates the record sequence. Both are empty records protected by
//! CRC32C, like every other record. Declared record counts, tags, and strict
//! decoding enforce the stream's ordering and completeness.
//!
//! Snapshot format version 1 is a work in progress and does not yet carry a
//! binary-compatibility guarantee.
